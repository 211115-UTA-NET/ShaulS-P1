grocery managment software

The software is designed for grocery store management

I implemented this project using C sharp.net.
the console application interact with a rest api web service
the web service connect to the database with ado.net
it Supports multiple users by using the database transactions
it Allows you to define customer and orders and manage 
inventory by store
And view order reports by store and by customer
